# Vibe

This project aims to build a blockchain protocol for a  distributed ledger system. I'm working on this project for fun and learning purpose. Also, I'm adding my own ideas with already exisiting approaches (testing and fiddling).


# Goals
- Implementing sharding for the first layer
- Better Dapps performance 
- Try to lower the environment cost of blockchain
